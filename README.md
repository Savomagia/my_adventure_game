# my_adventure_game
My first text adventure game

Here the list of problem faced and features implemented:

    # step_1    str.casefold(input) -> how to not break the loop with typo
    # step_2    while loop + nesting together 3 rooms = 3 loops (1 loop only was not working) -> with break you can go to the next loop
    # step_3    introduction of life points -> else condition to close the loop -> death -> game over!
    # step_4    implementation of a conter for number of moves made to solve the puzzle
    # step_5    "do you wanna play again?", "Insert Coin" :) options added
    # step_6    Introduction of .join method to improve user visualization
    # step_7    GUI? I don't know how to work with GUI, yet. In the future I will implement that.
    # step_8    How to jump back from a loop(room) to another.
